For his portrayal, Parsons has won four Primetime Emmy Awards, a Golden Globe Award, a TCA Award, and two Critics' Choice Television Awards. The character's childhood is the focus of Young Sheldon: the series' first season is set in 1989 when nine-year-old prodigy Sheldon has skipped ahead four grades, to start high school alongside his older brother. Parsons' portrayal of Sheldon on the show helped launch his career. He has gone on to appear in films such as Garden State, Wish I Was Here and Hidden Figures.\n\nParsons has been nominated for and won several awards for his portrayal of Sheldon, including four Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Television Series Musical or Comedy. In 2018, Forbes estimated his annual salary at \\$26.5 million.\n\nSheldon was born in East Texas and raised in Galveston. He has two siblings: a twin sister, Missy, and an older brother, George Jr. who is also referred to as \"Georgie\" (Jerry O'Connell). He also has a niece, Missy Cooper, and a nephew, Georgie Cooper Jr. His father died when he was 14, which is when he started taking care of his mother and his siblings. Sheldon is extremely fond of his maternal grandmother, whom he calls \"Meemaw\" (Annie Potts) and who calls him \"Moonpie\".\n\nSheldon's closest friends are Leonard Hofstadter (Johnny Galecki), his roommate for 10 years and colleague at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), and fellow Caltech colleagues Howard Wolowitz (Simon Helberg), Raj Koothrappali (Kunal Nayyar), Bernadette Rostenkowski (Melissa Rauch) and Amy Farrah Fowler (Mayim Bialik). He has two arch-enemies, Leslie Winkle (Sara Gilbert) and Wil Wheaton.\n\nSheldon's IQ of 187 is the fourth highest known amongst the characters of The Big Bang Theory, behind his mother, Missy, and Barry Kripke, who are also geniuses. He exhibits a strict adherence to routine and hygiene; an overreliance on ritualistic, pedantic behavior; avoidance of all things illogical; indifferently insulting behavior; a general lack of humility or empathy; and a blindpan lack of awareness of his own actions on others. These quirks can cause him to seem like a snobbish so-called \"know-it-all\", but Sheldon does not intend to insult others, and he is genuinely upset if he realizes he has offended someone.\n\nSheldon is often considered to be the most iconic character of The Big Bang Theory. In 2009, he was included in TV Guide's list of \"TV's Top 100 Characters of All Time\". In 2010, Entertainment Weekly named Sheldon one of the 100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years. In 2018, Sheldon was ranked number 1 on a list of the 11 Best Characters from The Big Bang Theory by Screen Rant. In 2018, he was placed at number 5 on Paste's list of The 25 Best TV Characters in the Past 25 Years. In 2018, Sheldon was ranked number 1 on a list of the 25 Greatest Geeks in TV History by IGN. In 2019, he was ranked at number 2 on TV Guide's list of the 25 Top TV Characters in the Past 25 Years. In 2020, Sheldon was ranked at number 3 on Looper's list of the 15 Most Hated Sitcom Characters of All Time. In 2021, he was ranked at number 1 on Screen Rant's list of the 10 Most Hated Sitcom Characters of All Time.\n\nSheldon is a senior theoretical particle physicist at Caltech. His work is primarily concerned with string theory and its alter ego M-theory. He has proposed theories for quantum gravity, quantum electrodynamics and dark matter. He has conducted research on the Alcubierre drive and the Drake equation. He has also performed research on the Higgs boson, the Higgs mechanism and supersymmetry. He has also worked on the string landscape, the anthropic principle and the multiverse. He has also worked on the theory of everything, the fine-tuning problem and the Holographic principle. He has also worked on the AdS/CFT correspondence, the holographic principle and the black hole information paradox. He has also worked on the black hole firewall paradox, the black hole information paradox and the black hole firewall paradox.

Now we're going to prove that the square root of two is irrational. So first we're gonna suppose that the square root of two is rational. So that means we can write it as the ratio of two integers. So we're gonna say a over B is equal to the square root of two. Now, since a and B are integers, we can assume that a and B are relatively prime. So that means the greatest common factor of a and B is one. So we have a over B is equal to the square root of two. So that means a squared over B squared is equal to two. And then we can multiply both sides by B squared and we get a squared is equal to two times B squared. So that means a squared is even. And we know that the square of an odd number is odd, so a has to be even. So that means a is equal to two times C for some integer C. So if we plug that into a squared, we get four times c squared. So we have four times c squared is equal to two times B squared. So we can divide both sides by two and we get two times c squared is equal to B squared. So we see that B squared is even, so be must be even. So we have a is even and B is even. So they have a common factor of two. So that contradicts the fact that a and B are relatively prime. So we have a contradiction. So we must have that the square root of two is irrational.\n\n#### Topics\n\nNo Related Subtopics", "#### Topics\n\nNo Related Subtopics\n\nProve that there are infinitely many prime numbers. \u0e48user,user\n\n#### Topics\n\nNo Related Subtopics\n\nProve that for every integer n, n^2 - n is even. \u0e48user,user\n\n#### Topics\n\nNo Related Subtopics"]}], "tstamp": 1719898601.338169}

I mean, why? Why would you go from a great database to a mediocre one? Anyway, this is not the point of this post, and it is not my place to question the company's decisions. I just wanted to set the context.\n\nSo, we need to migrate data from a PostgreSQL database to a MySQL database. It should be a piece of cake, right? Just dump the data from the PostgreSQL database and import it into the MySQL database. Well, it is not that simple. The PostgreSQL database is huge, and the MySQL database is not that powerful. So, we need to find a way to migrate the data without overloading the MySQL database. This is where the fun begins.\n\nWe tried a few different approaches, but none of them worked.

If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\n\nFor example, the median of the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is 3, and the median of the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] is 3.5.\n\nTo find the median of two sorted arrays of different sizes, we can use a modified binary search algorithm. The basic idea is to find the kth smallest element in the two arrays, where k is the median index. We can do this by comparing the k/2th element of the first array with the k/2th element of the second array. If the k/2th element of the first array is smaller, we know that the kth smallest element must be in the first k/2 elements of the first array or the second array. If the k/2th element of the first array is larger, we know that the kth smallest element must be in the last k/2 elements of the first array or the second array. We can then repeat this process until we find the kth smallest element.\n\nHere is an example implementation of this algorithm in C++:\n\n```c++\ndouble findMedianSortedArrays(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {\n    int m = nums1.size();\n    int n = nums2.size();\n    if (m > n) {\n        return findMedianSortedArrays(nums2, nums1);\n    }\n    int low = 0;\n    int high = m;\n    while (low <= high) {\n        int i = (low + high) / 2;\n        int j = (m + n + 1) / 2 - i;\n        int maxLeft1 = (i == 0)? INT_MIN : nums1[i - 1];\n        int minRight1 = (i == m)? INT_MAX : nums1[i];\n        int maxLeft2 = (j == 0)? INT_MIN : nums2[j - 1];\n        int minRight2 = (j == n)? INT_MAX : nums2[j];\n        if (maxLeft1 <= minRight2 && maxLeft2 <= minRight1) {\n            if ((m + n) % 2 == 0) {\n                return (double)(max(maxLeft1, maxLeft2) + min(minRight1, minRight2)) / 2;\n            } else {\n                return (double)max(maxLeft1, maxLeft2);\n            }\n        } else if (maxLeft1 > minRight2) {\n            high = i - 1;\n        } else {\n            low = i + 1;\n        }\n    }\n    return 0.0;\n}\n```\n\nThis function takes two sorted arrays as input and returns the median of the two arrays. It first checks if the first array is larger than the second array, and if so, it swaps the two arrays. This ensures that the first array is always smaller than or equal to the second array, which simplifies the algorithm.\n\nThe function then uses a binary search algorithm to find the kth smallest element in the two arrays, where k is the median index. It starts by setting the low and high indices to 0 and m (the size of the first array), respectively. It then enters a while loop that continues until low is greater than high.\n\nInside the loop, the function calculates the i and j indices, which represent the k/2th element of the first and second arrays, respectively. It then calculates the maximum left and minimum right elements of the two arrays, taking into account the possibility that i or j may be 0 or equal to the size of the array.\n\nNext, the function checks if the maximum left element of the first array is less than or equal to the minimum right element of the second array, and if the maximum left element of the second array is less than or equal to the minimum right element of the first array. If both conditions are true, the function has found the kth smallest element, and it returns the median based on whether the total number of elements is even or odd.\n\nIf the maximum left element of the first array is greater than the minimum right element of the second array, the function sets high to i - 1, indicating that the kth smallest element must be in the first k/2 elements of the first array or the second array. If the maximum left element of the first array is less than the minimum right element of the second array, the function sets low to i + 1, indicating that the kth smallest element must be in the last k/2 elements of the first array or the second array.\n\nThe function continues this process until it finds the kth smallest element, and then returns the median. The time", "Yes, there is an implementation with better time complexity. The above implementation has a time complexity of O(log(min(m, n))), where m and n are the sizes of the two input arrays. However, it is possible to achieve a time complexity of O(log(m + n)) by using a different approach.\n\nOne way to achieve this is by using a modified binary search algorithm that searches for the kth smallest element in the two arrays, where k is the median index. The basic idea is to compare the k/2th element of the first array with the k/2th element of the second array, and then recursively search for the kth smallest element in the appropriate subarray.\n\nHere is an example implementation of this algorithm in C++:\n\n```c++\ndouble findMedianSortedArrays(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {\n    int m = nums1.size();\n    int n = nums2.size();\n    if (m > n) {\n        return findMedianSortedArrays(nums2, nums1);\n    }\n    int low = 0;\n    int high = m;\n    while (low <= high) {\n        int i = (low + high) / 2;\n        int j = (m + n + 1) / 2 - i;\n        int maxLeft1 = (i == 0)? INT_MIN : nums1[i - 1];\n        int minRight1 = (i == m)? INT_MAX : nums1[i];\n        int maxLeft2 = (j == 0)? INT_MIN : nums2[j - 1];\n        int minRight2 = (j == n)? INT_MAX : nums2[j];\n        if (maxLeft1 <= minRight2 && maxLeft2 <= minRight1) {\n            if ((m + n) % 2 == 0) {\n                return (double)(max(maxLeft1, maxLeft2) + min(minRight1, minRight2)) / 2;\n            } else {\n                return (double)max(maxLeft1, maxLeft2);\n            }\n        } else if (maxLeft1 > minRight2) {\n            high = i - 1;\n        } else {\n            low = i + 1;\n        }\n    }\n    return 0.0;\n}\n```\n\nThis function is similar to the previous implementation, but it uses a different approach to find the kth smallest element. Instead of searching for the kth smallest element in the entire array, it searches for the kth smallest element in the appropriate subarray based on the comparison of the k/2th elements of the two arrays.\n\nThe time complexity of this implementation is O(log(m + n)), which is better than the previous implementation. This is because the algorithm only needs to search for the kth smallest element in the appropriate subarray, rather than searching for the kth smallest element in the entire array. This reduces the number of comparisons and improves the time complexity.\n\nOverall, this implementation is more efficient than the previous implementation, and it can be used to find the median of two sorted arrays of different sizes with O(1) space complexity and O(log(m + n)) time complexity."]}], "tstamp": 1719901509.5481303}

Still, its power and intelligence are unrivaled.\n- CNET's review of the latest Samsung Galaxy: The Samsung Galaxy phone has plenty of high points, including an amazing screen, fast performance, solid battery life and an impressive array of camera options.

The new Galaxy is an amazing phone overall, but it has a few nagging weaknesses that keep it from achieving true greatness.\n- The Verge's review of the latest Google Pixel: Google's Pixel packs cutting-edge specs, innovative AI-powered software, and a killer camera into a sleek design. However, the phone has lackluster battery life, lacks expandable storage, and its performance stutters at times, especially considering its high price tag.

Introduction\n\nThe economy is a complex system that is influenced by a variety of factors. Economic indicators such as GDP, inflation, and unemployment rates are used to measure the health of an economy. Fiscal and monetary policies are used to influence these indicators and shape the overall economic landscape. In this article, we will explore the correlation between economic indicators and how fiscal and monetary policies affect them.\n\n## 2. Economic Indicators\n\nEconomic indicators are used to measure the health of an economy. The most commonly used indicators are GDP, inflation, and unemployment rates.\n\n### 2.1 GDP\n\nGDP, or Gross Domestic Product, is a measure of the total value of goods and services produced in a country over a given period of time. It is used to measure the size of an economy and its growth rate. GDP is calculated by adding up the value of all goods and services produced in a country, minus the value of any goods and services imported.\n\n### 2.2 Inflation\n\nInflation is a measure of the rate at which prices for goods and services are increasing. It is calculated by comparing the prices of a basket of goods and services over a given period of time. Inflation can be caused by a variety of factors, including increases in the money supply, increases in production costs, and changes in demand.\n\n### 2.3 Unemployment Rates\n\nUnemployment rates measure the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed. It is calculated by dividing the number of unemployed people by the total labor force. Unemployment rates can be affected by a variety of factors, including changes in the economy, changes in the labor market, and changes in government policies.\n\n## 3. Correlation Between Economic Indicators\n\nThe three economic indicators discussed above are closely related. Changes in one indicator can have an effect on the other two. For example, an increase in GDP can lead to an increase in inflation, as more money is available to purchase goods and services. Similarly, an increase in inflation can lead to an increase in unemployment, as businesses may be forced to reduce their workforce in order to remain competitive.\n\n## 4. Fiscal and Monetary Policies\n\nFiscal and monetary policies are used to influence economic indicators. Fiscal policy refers to the government\u2019s use of taxation and spending to influence the economy. Monetary policy refers to the central bank\u2019s use of interest rates and money supply to influence the economy.\n\n### 4.1 Fiscal Policy\n\nFiscal policy is used to influence economic indicators by changing the amount of money available in the economy. For example, the government can increase spending in order to stimulate the economy, or it can reduce spending in order to reduce inflation. The government can also use taxation to influence the economy, by increasing taxes in order to reduce inflation or decreasing taxes in order to stimulate the economy.\n\n### 4.2 Monetary Policy\n\nMonetary policy is used to influence economic indicators by changing the money supply and interest rates. The central bank can increase the money supply in order to stimulate the economy, or it can reduce the money supply in order to reduce inflation. The central bank can also use interest rates to influence the economy, by increasing interest rates in order to reduce inflation or decreasing interest rates in order to stimulate the economy.\n\n## 5. Conclusion\n\nEconomic indicators such as GDP, inflation, and unemployment rates are used to measure the health of an economy. Fiscal and monetary policies are used to influence these indicators and shape the overall economic landscape. By understanding the correlation between economic indicators and how fiscal and monetary policies affect them, we can gain valuable insights into the economy and make informed decisions.", "## 1.
